# streamhub-wall

LiveMediaWalls allow you to create a real-time social wall for your site. Use the Livefyre StreamHub SDK's streamhub-wall package to display Livefyre social feeds as a visually engaging, full-screen, tiled content experience that's great for covering live events, hosting photo contests, and powering social sections of your website.

Stream live images and other content aggregated from Instagram, Twitter, Vine and more into a real-time media wall, visualizing all activity surrounding an event so that even those following remotely feel like they are there. Display LiveMediaWalls on big screens at live events, or add it to your website to ensure that your site is the go-to destination for live event coverage.
